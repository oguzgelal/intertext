TODO: 1. Setup mono-repo
TODO: 2. Refactor the Engine (TS) out
TODO: 3. Setup a cpp package for the engine


Thoughts: Intertext Engine in CPP ?
1. It will run natively everywhere
2. Thanks to WebAssembly, it will run on the web
3. Extremely performance gains

Cons:
1. I'm not great with C++

Done: Relations now have ID's
Done: Everything is stored under the same roof in the registry
