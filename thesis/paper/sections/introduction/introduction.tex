\chapter{Introduction}

The leap in the Internet of Things (IoT) has opened doors to a new era in information technology in the recent decade. New realms of interconnected devices and device families introduced different ways of interacting with information. Emerging new tools, techniques, frameworks, libraries, and SDKs made it possible to build consumer-facing products in ways that were never possible before. (Fig ~\ref{fig:num_of_frameworks_used}) A recent survey \textit{State of JavaScript} reveals that around 60\% of developers use more than one Front-end framework, and for cross-platform frameworks this number is more than 80\% ~\cite{StateOfJs2020}. These advancements attracted many users and developers and helped to create a large and diverse market of consumer products, goods and services. However, it did not come without some hurdles. In this thesis, we explore what these hurdles are and discuss how Intertext addresses them.
