\section{Research Questions}

We have listed the problems that we are interested to solve in the section above. In light of these problems, we aim to answer the following questions in our research:

\paragraph{How can we re-imagine front-end, and improve it in such a way that:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item from the \underline{users perspective}, for \underline{all applications} it:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item presents a consistent User Experience (UX) ?
    \item works consistently on all supported devices and platforms ?
    \item allow users to customize the look and feel ?
    \item guarantees accessibility ?
    \item guarantees privacy ?
    \item guarantees security ?
  \end{enumerate}
  \item from the \underline{data-providers perspective}, it:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item eliminates the need to create visually-appealing front-end applications ?
    \item eliminates the need to create accessible front-end applications ?
    \item eliminates the need to create front-end applications for every device / platform ?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{How can we create an alternate front-end realm that:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item brings product development costs to a minimum?
  \item enables more variability of software products in the market?
  \item unifies the viewing experience, so individual developers and large companies compete on the same ground?
\end{enumerate}
