\section{Future Work} \label{futureWork}

discussion:
- problem statement problems (how much I achieved)
- limitations

future work:
- limitations to fix
- more intertext clients
- more themes
- user-made themes
- refined control on persisted storage (expiration dates)
- cross-origin storage read
- media queries
- permission flow for requests (requests outside same origin, images loaded from remote)
